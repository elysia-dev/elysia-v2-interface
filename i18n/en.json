These NFTs can be used in various financial systems without fear of forgery because transaction details are securely recorded on the blockchain.",

This is because the barriers to entry are high in the real estate market, even in the traditional financial market, where complex documents are required and large amounts of money are exchanged. ELYSIA DAO LLC. intends to create the world's first real estate NFT-based economic system based on its experience of trading multiple real estate and operating a separate blockchain technology team.",
